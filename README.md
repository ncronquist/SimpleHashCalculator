SimpleHashCalculator
==================================================================================================

Simple program to calculate MD5 or SHA1 file hashes... And also a fun way for me to learn some basic C# :)

Why Do I Need This?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You know those daily downloads of the latest nightly ROM for your phone? No? You don't do that? Ok, well then for the random time that you download a file that *does* include an MD5 or SHA1 checksum; this program will let you quickly verify that checksum.

How to Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the Select File button to choose a file and then choose your hash type. If you want you can paste the original hash value into the bottom text box to get a quick status check without doing the compare yourself.
